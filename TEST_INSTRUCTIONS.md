# CMS Testing Instructions

## Fixed Issues ✅
1. **Login Redirect**: After successful login, users are now properly redirected to `/manage`
2. **$fetch Error**: Fixed "$fetch is not a function" errors in all CMS pages by properly accessing `useNuxtApp()`

## Testing the CMS System

### 1. Setup Admin Account
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3001/login`
2. Click "Need to setup admin account?"
3. Fill in admin credentials:
   - Name: `Admin User`
   - Email: `admin@digitalflow.com`
   - Password: `admin123`
4. Click "Create Admin Account"
5. You should see "Admin account created successfully!" message

### 2. Test Login & Redirect
1. After setup, the form should switch to login mode
2. Enter the credentials you just created
3. Click "Sign In"
4. You should be automatically redirected to `/manage` dashboard
5. Verify you can see the CMS dashboard with stats

### 3. Test CMS Features

#### Home Page Management
1. Click "Edit Home Page" from dashboard
2. Modify any content field
3. Upload an image using drag & drop or URL
4. Click "Save Changes" - should show success message
5. Visit homepage to see changes

#### Services Management

2. Click "Add Service" to create a new service
3. Fill in service details and features

5. Test edit, activate/deactivate, and delete functions

#### Image Upload
1. In any content form, try uploading an image
2. Drag & drop an image file (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
3. Should show upload progress and preview
4. Alternatively, paste an image URL
5. Verify image displays correctly

### 4. Test Security
1. Try accessing `/manage` without login (should redirect to `/login`)
2. Test logout functionality
3. Verify protected API endpoints require authentication

### 5. Test Error Handling
1. Try uploading invalid file types
2. Try uploading files > 5MB

4. Verify appropriate error messages

## Expected Behavior

## Database Location
- SQLite database: `prisma/dev.db`
- Uploaded images: `public/uploads/`

## API Endpoints Working
- `POST /api/auth/setup` - Create admin
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login  
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Check auth status
- `GET|POST /api/cms/home-content` - Home content
- `GET|POST|PUT|DELETE /api/cms/services` - Services
- `POST /api/upload/image` - Image upload

All issues have been resolved and the CMS should now function properly!
